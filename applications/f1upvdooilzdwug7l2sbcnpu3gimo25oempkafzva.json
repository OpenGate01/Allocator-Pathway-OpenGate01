    "Brief history of your project and organization": "UTS offers over 130 undergraduate and 210 postgraduate courses across traditional and emerging disciplines such as architecture, built environment, business, communication, design, education, engineering, information technology, international studies, law, midwifery, nursing, pharmacy and science.\r\n\r\nIn line with the UTS model of global practice-oriented learning, many of our students undertake professional practice during their degree. As part of their degree program, students also have the opportunity to study at one of more than 185 universities in about 40 countries with which UTS has exchange agreements.\r\n\r\nOur world leading research centres span a range of disciplines, including physical, biological and engineering sciences, and contemporary fields such as design, nanotechnology and sustainability. Our researchers provide practical and relevant solutions to issues of national and international importance and equip graduates with the latest discipline specific skills and practices.\r\n\r\nWe also maintain strong relationships with the local community, industry, business and the professions through a wide range of partnerships, projects and events.\r\n\r\nAs a public purpose institution, UTS is committed to supporting positive social change within and beyond our campus. This commitment is reflected by a diverse set of institution wide social justice initiatives that have only expanded in scope and impact since UTS was established. Student-based programs, focused research and innovative teaching approaches aim to create a more just and equitable world.\r\n\r\nOn 26 January 1988 — with the commencement of the University of Technology, Sydney, Act — the former New South Wales Institute of Technology became the University of Technology, Sydney.\r\n\r\nThe New South Wales Institute of Technology was established in 1964. The School of Design of the former Sydney College of the Arts was incorporated into the Institute on 25 January 1988.\r\n\r\nOn 1 January 1990, the Institute of Technical and Adult Teacher Education and the Kuring-gai College of Advanced Education were amalgamated with the existing University of Technology, Sydney to form the current UTS. On 1 August 2015, the comma was removed from the University’s title to become the current University of Technology Sydney.\r\n\r\nThe purpose and functions of UTS are outlined in the University of Technology Sydney Act 1989 (NSW) and in the constitutions of its controlled entities.",
